<i class="fa-solid fa-user"></i> About Me
======
I'm currently a second year Master student in the [School of Computer Science Technology](https://cs.fudan.edu.cn/main.htm), 
[Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Jin Zhao](https://jinzhaofd.github.io/). I obtained my
B.Eng. degree from [Northeastern University](http://www.neu.edu.cn/) in 2019.

<i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i> Research Interests
======
My research interests lie in computer networking and systems. Below are the major projects I participated in.
- Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) Accelerating. As an intern in Intel from Feb. 2022 to now, I'm a developer of [Hyperscan](https://github.com/intel/hyperscan), 
the fastest regular expression matching engine running on modern CPUs. I would convert the processes of multi-string 
matching and DFA transformation, critical stages of Hyperscan's workflow, into bitwise operations and take advantage of 
SIMD to accelerate them. Hyperscan has been integrated into famous DPI applications such as Snort and Suricata. 
It dramatically increases their real-time packet processing capability. Relevant works have been published in 
[NSDI](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3323234.3323286), [ICPP](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3472456.3473512), 
and [INFOCOM](https://haoxufd.github.io/files/Harry.pdf).
- IPU Feature Development. As an intern in Intel, I also work on developing new features for IPU based on the specific requirements of Google Cloud. This involves the offloading of fundamental infrastructure‑related tasks from CPU to IPU.
- SDN. I used to work in [Sangfor](https://www.sangfor.com/) Virtual Network Department for a year, where I worked with 
a seven-person team to develop the control plane of an SDN system.
- P4 Gateway Testbed. I worked in [Bytedance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/) as an intern from May 2021 to Aug. 2021, 
supervised by [Chuanxiong Guo](https://sysnetome.com/index.html). I built a testbed to test the functionality and 
performance of P4 gateway. The testbed utilizes a single server to simulate multiple network topologies(e.g. gateway 
connecting with switches, gateway connecting with servers, gateway connecting with both switches and servers).
